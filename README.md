# Model-Based-Clustering
In model-based clustering, data is modeled using a standard statistical model to work with different distributions. 
The idea is to find a model that best fits the data. The best-fit model is achieved by tuning up parameters to minimize loss on errors. 
Once the parameter values are set, probability membership can be calculated for new data points using the model. Model-based clustering gives a probability distribution over clusters.
There are different algorithms that considered as model based clustring Like Gaussian Mixture Model, SOM (Self Organized Map), and COBWEB.

In this work, Guassian Mixture Model and SOM are used to clusters airlines to 3 clusters for safety purpose into:
1. Safe airlines.
2. Doubtfully safe airlines.
3. Risky airlines.
